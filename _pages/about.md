Hi I’m Gabriel, currently a 1st year Masters student majoring in Operations Research at the MIT Operations Research Center. I am advised by Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat. I did my Bachelors of Engineering in Engineering Systems and Design at SUTD. My area of research is on Transportation, specifically Microtransit. Topics like Linear Optimization, Probability and Statistics as well as Machine Learning keep me going in life. Looking to keep going and keep studying as life goes on.
